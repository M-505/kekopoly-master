# Bug Fixes Applied

## Issue 1: Players Can't See Each Other in Game Room

**Problem**: The `broadcastPlayerInfo` function was exiting early when `initialPlayerData` wasn't provided, preventing players from seeing each other after the initial connection.

**Fix**: 
- Removed the early exit condition that required `initialPlayerData`
- Modified the function to fall back to Redux store data when `initialPlayerData` is not provided
- Re-enabled the broadcast call in the connection effect to ensure players sync properly
- Added fallback mechanism to create minimal player data if Redux store doesn't have the player info yet

**Files Modified**: 
- `/kekopoly-frontend/src/components/lobby/GameRoom.jsx`

## Issue 2: Missing Logout Option in Purple Dropdown

**Problem**: The logout menu item was commented out in the GameLobby component.

**Fix**:
- Uncommented and implemented the logout functionality 
- Added proper logout action dispatch and navigation to login page

**Files Modified**:
- `/kekopoly-frontend/src/components/lobby/GameLobby.jsx`

## Testing Steps

1. **Player Visibility Test**:
   - Open two browser tabs/windows
   - Log in with different accounts
   - Create a game room with one account
   - Join the same room with the second account
   - Both players should now be visible to each other in the players list

2. **Logout Test**:
   - In the game lobby, click on the purple dropdown button (shows wallet address)
   - You should now see a "Disconnect Wallet" option
   - Clicking it should log you out and redirect to the login page

## Technical Details

The player visibility issue was caused by an overly restrictive broadcast mechanism that only worked during initial registration. The fix ensures that player information is continuously synchronized between all connected clients, especially important for:

- Reconnection scenarios
- Late joiners
- Network interruptions
- Browser refresh cases

The logout issue was simply a matter of uncommenting existing functionality that had been disabled.
