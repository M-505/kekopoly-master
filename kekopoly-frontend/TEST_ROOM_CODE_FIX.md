# Testing Room Code Fix

This document provides a step-by-step test plan to verify that the room code mismatch issue has been resolved.

## Test Scenario: Two Players Joining the Same Game

### Setup
1. Start the backend server: `cd kekopoly-backend && go run cmd/server/main.go`
2. Start the frontend: `cd kekopoly-frontend && npm run dev`
3. Open two browser windows/tabs (or use two different browsers)

### Test Steps

#### Player A (Host):
1. Open the app and log in with email/password
2. Click "Create New Game" 
3. Enter a game name (e.g., "Test Room Code Fix")
4. Click "Create Game"
5. **Note the room code displayed** (should be 6 characters, e.g., "LEKN6M")
6. Copy the room code for sharing
7. Wait in the game room

#### Player B (Joiner):
1. Open the app in a second browser and log in with different credentials
2. From the lobby, look for Player A's game in the "Available Games" section
3. Click "Join Game" on Player A's game
4. **Note the room code displayed** (should match Player A's code exactly)

### Expected Results âœ…

1. **Room codes match**: Both players should see the identical room code (e.g., "LEKN6M")
2. **Players see each other**: Both players should appear in the players list
3. **Host status correct**: Player A should show as "Host" 
4. **Ready functionality works**: Both players can toggle ready status
5. **Game start works**: Host can start the game when both players are ready

### What Was Fixed

**Before the fix:**
- Player A (host): Room code "lekn6m" 
- Player B (joiner): Room code "6869379d75574cdc9952abed"
- Result: Players isolated in separate game instances

**After the fix:**
- Player A (host): Room code "lekn6m"
- Player B (joiner): Room code "lekn6m" (now fetches the short code)
- Result: Both players in same game instance

### Debugging Tips

If the test fails:

1. **Check browser console logs** for both players
   - Look for "Join game response" and "Game details" logs
   - Verify roomCode values match

2. **Check backend logs** 
   - Should show both players connecting to the same game session
   - Look for "Player X joined game Y" messages with same game ID

3. **Test room code entry**
   - Try manually entering the room code in "Join by Code" section
   - Should work for both 6-character codes and long game IDs

### Additional Tests

1. **Direct room code entry**: Test entering room codes manually in "Join by Code"
2. **Game restart**: Create a new game and repeat the test
3. **Mixed joining**: One player via lobby, one via direct room code entry
4. **Network issues**: Test with browser refresh during join process

## API Changes Made

- Modified `handleJoinGame` in `GameLobby.jsx` to fetch game details first
- Extract room code from game details instead of using game ID for navigation
- Added fallback error handling in case API calls fail

This ensures all players use the consistent short room code format regardless of how they join the game.
